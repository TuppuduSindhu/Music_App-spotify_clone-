# Overall Project Description 

**Music Mantra** is a fully front-end **Spotify UI clone** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The goal of this project is to recreate the core look and feel of Spotify’s web interface and demonstrate my skills in **UI design, component structuring, and JavaScript-based interactivity**.

The application features a complete Spotify-like layout, including a left navigation sidebar, top navigation bar, playlists section, interactive music cards, and a responsive footer. Users can hover over any playlist item to reveal the play button and instantly play the associated audio. All songs are built using `<audio>` components and controlled with JavaScript.

This project focuses on **front-end development principles**, such as layout structuring, hover animations, responsive design, DOM manipulation, and event handling. It was built without any backend or authentication, making it a lightweight music player that can run in any browser.
